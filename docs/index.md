# Welcome to Sapsan!

Sapsan is a pipeline for Machine Learning (ML) based turbulence modeling. While turbulence is important in a wide range of mediums, the pipeline primarily focuses on astrophysical application. With Sapsan, one can create their own custom models or use either conventional or physics-informed ML approaches for turbulence modeling included with the pipeline ([estimators](/details/estimators)). For example, Sapsan features ML models in its set of tools to accurately capture the turbulent nature applicable to Core-Collapse Supernovae.

## Purpose
        
 Sapsan takes out all the hard work from data preparation and analysis in turbulence 
 and astrophysical applications, leaving you focused on ML model design, layer by layer.

## Website
Feel free to check out a website version with a few examples at [sapsan.app](http://sapsan.app). The interface is identical to the GUI of the local version of Sapsan, except lacking the ability to edit the model code on the fly and to use mlflow for tracking.

Note: currently Sapsan is in beta, but we are actively working on it and introduce new features on a daily basis.
